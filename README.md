# Engine information
Here is a little explanation of how the features of the engine work.

- There is a main menu bar at the top, which has:
	- File
	- Edit
	- Assets
	- Help

- File: With the following options (New Scene, Open Scene, Save, Save as, Close, Exit).
From these ones we only have implemented Close and Exit for now. "Close" closes the File menu and "Exit" closes the engine.

- Edit: Menu to edit the tools of the engine. Not implemented yet.

- Assets: Menu to create primitive objects and to import assets from your PC. Not implemented yet.

- Help: Opens a menu with 1 button called "About". This button opens a menu with all the info of the engine.


- There is a HierarchyTab which will show the hierarchy of the scene.

- There is an inspectorTab that will show the components of the selected object.

- There is an assetsTab that will show the main path of the Assets in the engine.

- There is a consoleTab that should show the debug log of the engine.

- There is a performance window that shows the FPS.

# Special information
- Textures aren't implemented yet in this release because they were giving us a lot of trouble.
- Some meshes don't import well when drag and dropping.
